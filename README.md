# Bioinformatics-Machine-learning-models-
This project uses Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa having different resistance patterns across different antibiotics. The model uses three classifiers for antimicrobial resistance prediction, using robust evaluation (both hold-out and CV), reporting standard metrics, and the results were visualised.

The standard metrics which were used during the model evaluation are
Accuracy,
Sensitivity,
Specificity,
ROC AUC,
F1 Score,
Cohenâ€™s Kappa,
